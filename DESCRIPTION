Description: The PVdagger package provides tools for creating and
    visualizing Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with various biases and
    paths. This package is particularly useful for researchers and signal
    managers in pharmacovigilance who need to illustrate causal
    relationships and potential biases in their data. The package
    leverages the DiagrammeR library to generate high-quality DAGs.
